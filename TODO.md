# TODO LIST
For an always up-to-date ToDo-list, please refer to this document 

- [x] Remove "commonlinux" directory and seperate it into *Linux* and *Common* directories and search accordingly. (Check if ARGV[0] exists in Linux, if not then search in Common)

- [x] Update all pages using the archive available at [tldr.sh/assets/tldr.zip](tldr.sh/assets/tldr.zip) and not using Github.

- [x] Perhaps create a seperate method just for parsing the .md documents.

- [ ] [still needs work] Add support for searching the commands of other operating systems (using an *--operating system* and *-os* flag) [Implemented in a different way. All commands for all operating systems are available without the need of adding an additional flag. The corresponding OS is listed at the top... still needs work, usage of -os flag might be better since there are several of the same commands for each operating system)

- [x] Automatically download missing pages (perhaps with json file)
