# Ruby TLDR
## What is this?
There exists a project called "TLDR" which will output a short explanation of the most commonly used command that was specified by the user (tldr tree will yield information about tree in a short yet precise manner). The goal of RubyTldr is to port that project, which was originally written in some other languages, to Ruby. There already exists such a project, however for the sake of getting some programming practice I am now making my own which is quite different from the the other one as far as I have been able to tell.

## How to use RubyTldr
The usage of RubyTldr is as straightforward as the original tldr â€“ Simply start the .rb file and append a command you wish to get more information on and RubyTldr will display it on your terminal in various colours. I will be adding an installer which will be similar to the installler I've already created for my RuXt program.
