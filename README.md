# Ruby TLDR
## What is this?
There exists a project called "TLDR" which will output a short explanation of the most commonly used command that was specified by the user (tldr tree will yield information about tree in a short yet precise manner). The goal of RubyTldr is to port that project, which was originally written in some other languages, to Ruby. There already exists such a project, however for the sake of getting some programming practice I am now making my own which is quite different from the the other one as far as I have been able to tell.

## Installation and usage
To install Tldr you can simply run the following command (on Linux if you have wget installed): `wget raw.githubusercontent.com/Jeytas/Installers/master/installer_tldr.sh ; bash installer_tldr.sh ; rm -rf installer_tldr.sh`, download the installer yourself and inspect it before running: [Installer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jeytas/Installers/master/installer_tldr.sh) or just clone the repository and install it yourself.

### How to use RubyTldr
The usage of RubyTldr is as straightforward as the original tldr â€“ Simply start the .rb file and append a command you wish to get more information on and RubyTldr will display it on your terminal in various colours. I will be adding an installer which will be similar to the installler I've already created for my RuXt programhelp for that programhelp for that program
