* TODO
For an always up-to-date ToDo-list, please refer to this document 
** Remove "commonlinux" directory and seperate it into *Linux* and *Common* directories and search accordingly. (Check if ARGV[0] exists in Linux, if not then search in Common)
** Update all pages using the archive available at [[tldr.sh/assets/tldr.zip]] and not using Github.
** Perhaps create a seperate method just for parsing the .md documents.
